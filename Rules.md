# Rules and Regulations
## Competition format
The competition is divided into two sections (`people's choice` and `judges’ choices`) and all the participants will be automatically eligible for both of these. The theme for each month’s competition will be notified over email. The competition will be active for 20 days, during which the participants can submit a maximum of 3 photos to the ongoing theme.
### People’s choice
All the photos will be up for voting by the campus community. At the end of the competition, the two most voted images will be declared as winner and runner-up. In case of a tie, the entries with the highest number of votes, will be considered as winners.
### Judges’ choice
At the end of each round (theme) of the competition, our judges will assign points to each of the entries, and the one(s) with the most number of points will be declared as winners.

*Winners’ photo(s) will be framed and displayed on the corridor next to reception for that entire month, following which, winner may take printed photo (if any) as a souvenir. Winning entries will be projected on the electronic display boards across campus.*

Competition will be carried out in following three phases
* `Submission phase` Participants can upload their photos for ongoing theme which will be eligible for both the categories (People’s choice as well as Judges’ choice)
* `Voting phase` Anyone with valid NCBS/InStem/CCAMP email ID can vote for People’s choice category.
* `Judging phase` Verification of photos for both categories and judging of photos for Judge’s choice category.

## Judges

On a trial basis, we are introducing a new rule for the selection of judges. The panel of judges will comprise of two experts, as well as the winners from the previous month. Hence, the latter will be unable to participate in the ongoing competition, but will be able to rejoin from the following month. This is in all fairness to boost the confidence of new photographers.

## Eligibility
Anyone with a valid NCBS/InStem/CCAMP email account can participate in the competition.
