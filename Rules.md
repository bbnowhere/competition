# Rules and Regulations
## Competition format
The competition is divided into two sections (`People’s choice` and `Judges’ choice`) and all the participants will be automatically eligible for both of these. The theme for each month’s competition will be notified over email. The participants can submit a maximum of 3 photos to the ongoing theme.
### People’s choice
All the photos will be up for voting by the campus community. At the end of the competition, the two (or more, see below) most voted images will be declared as winner and runner-up. In case of a tie, the entries with the highest number of votes, will be considered as winners. 
### Judges’ choice
At the end of each round (theme) of the competition, our judges will assign points to each of the entries, and the one(s) with the most number of points will be declared as winners. 

*Winning entries will be projected on the electronic display boards across campus.*

Competition will be carried out in following three phases
* `Submission phase` Participants can upload their photos for ongoing theme which will be eligible for both the categories (People’s choice as well as Judges’ choice)
* `Voting phase` Anyone with valid NCBS/InStem/CCAMP email ID can vote for People’s choice category.
* `Judging phase` Verification of photos for both categories and judging of photos for Judge’s choice category.

## Judges

On a trial basis, we are introducing a new rule for the selection of judges. The panel of judges will comprise of two experts, as well as the winners from the previous month. Hence, the latter will be unable to participate in the ongoing competition, but will be able to rejoin from the following month. This is in all fairness to boost the confidence of new photographers. 

## Eligibility
Anyone with a valid NCBS/InStem/CCAMP email account can participate in the competition. (See below note about guests and special uploads)

## How to participate
 1. One must be on the NCBS network to upload photos.
 2. Go to https://intranet.ncbs.res.in/photography on the browser and login to your NCBS account (*login option will be on the top of page*). Please note that one cannot upload photos without logging in.
 3. The current theme and the photos uploaded by other users to this theme, will appear selected. One can only participate in the ongoing theme. However, one can always browse through the old photos.
 4. Click on ‘upload your photo’, to submit your entries. The current limit to the size each photo is 5 MB. One must assign an appropriate caption to their image, as well as a description (optional). The uploaded photo will be automatically submitted to current theme.
 5. One can also vote and/or comment on other submitted photos.
 
 
 ## Rules for photo submission
 
  * The participant should be the sole owner of the uploaded photo. The NCBS Honour Code is applicable here.
  * One can upload a photo taken from mobile cameras, point and shoot, DSLRs, microscopes etc.
  * Please note that one cannot delete an already uploaded photo, even if you are the owner of the same. However, one can edit the photo, its caption and/or description, at any time. See ‘Terms and Conditions’ section for further details.
  * If a photo is selected for by the people or the judges, the participant should be able to send a high resolution unedited image of the same. Original image SHOULD include all the metadata. Images without any metadata will not be accepted for the competition.
  * General photo editing like contrast, brightness, temperature, saturation etc., as well as cropping, HDR and stitched panorama is allowed. One can also use photo filters if needed for the theme or to convey a message, however it is advised not to use them excessively.
  * Use of watermark of any kind is acceptable, but discouraged. If you insist on using one, please use it non-destructively and subtly. Proper image credits will be given when your photo is printed and framed.
  * Do not use portraits without permission of the subject and/or model. Do not use any copyrighted or inappropriate material.
  * Do not use inappropriate caption or description.

## Terms and conditions

 * Participant will be the sole copyrighted owner of the uploaded photo.
 * Winner can decide not to frame and/or display a photo.
 * Due to policies of the NCBS IT section, a participant cannot delete any photo that is already uploaded. However, they can edit or change it. If you want to delete a photo, please email the IT section (ithelp@ncbs.res.in) regarding the same.
 * Keep a copy of the original photo with you. Organisers are not responsible for any loss of photos due to any technical reason.
 * Organisers will not take the responsibility for any delay or suspension of the photo competition. We will try our best to run this competition smoothly.
 * Organisers hold the right to stop or suspend the competition at any time.
 * Organisers are not responsible for the quality of photo printed or any related delay.
 * Rules and regulations might be changed or modified without any notice. 


## Special cases and related policies 
### Cancellation of competition
Organisers might cancel ongoing competition if there are less than 10 entries in the competition. In such cases organisers will declare cancelation of current competition and will start new theme. Organisers might also cancel on going competition without any notice if there is any technical or administrative problem.  
### Number of winners
Total number of winners will be decided based on number of entries in the contest. There will be 1 winner per 15 entries or 2 (whichever is maximum). However, if there is a tie amongst the winners, number of winners might increase/decrease accordingly.
### Guest uploads 
We constantly get requests regarding participation in contest by the users who do not have valid institute email address. Currently entire competition is linked to intranet and all uploads, votes are linked to specific email account. Hence (for now) it is not possible to incorporate guest uploads. We will update our rules and regulations once we have some mechanism in place to tackle this problem. We cannot allow upload through friend/colleagues account because it will create some unnecessary loop holes into photo uploading policies. Also, it will be logistically difficult to organize. 
### Number of judges
We try our best to get expert judges and encourage previous competition winners to judge contest photos. However, that is subject to availability of judges. Sometimes we may not get enough judges to have Judges’ choice section. In such cases, organisers may try to contact other experts or experienced photographers to judge. At the end, if we have less than 2 judges, we might have to cancel the ‘Judges’ choice’ section of the competition. Organisers will take final decision regarding this. 
### Multiple photo uploads
As per our rules and regulations, maximum of 3 photos are allowed per theme. It is participant’s responsibility to check how much photos they are uploading. As photographers’ names are hidden in voting and uploading phase, it is not possible for organisers to detect and notify users who have uploaded more than 3 photos. If any photographer has uploaded more than 3 photos to current competition, only first 3 photos (based on uploading timestamps) will be considered for the competition. Rest of the photos may be removed from the website. 
### Judges’ scores
Judges’ score which have received after provided deadline will not be considered for the final calculation of ‘Judges’ choice’ score. Judges can contact organisers if they are unable to send scores before deadline. Organisers will always send one reminder before the deadline.  
### Runner up photos
To promote more photographers, we have started displaying runner up photos on the electronic display across campus. Number of runner up photos selected to display on the electronic display will be decided by the organisers. We will generally show 6 photos per sections. However, if there are multiple photos with same score, we might adjust this number.
