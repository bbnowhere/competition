# Competition No : 25

## THEME : Rain and Life 

When the life is burnt down in Summer, we say “Wait for the rain”
When the river Kaveri becomes a topic on the table, “Wait for the monsoon”
When you see your houses and city covered in dust and garbage, “Rain will be here soon”
When the youngster gets happy seeing a newly laid tar road, the Old say, “Monsoon is here!”
Well,once the Rain is here we forget everything; forget all the problems and welcome the rain, celebrate the rain, not even
trying to recall that we had made pledges on conservation measures. 
Well,we still can’t say, when the time will come when we will say, “There used to be monsoon after summer”, for we tend to always destroy our planet; playing trumps on her resources.. 

This time we want you to document the Rain, which brings life to the planet..
