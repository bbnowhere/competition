Do you ever feel like you were born in the wrong generation? 
Or feel like things were better in the past or life was easier then? 
Are you an old soul who loves to do old school things?  
Well, here is your chance to portray the glorious past! 
For the month of May, we want you to dig into your old collections and bring out all that is VINTAGE!  
But what is vintage? It is anything of high quality from the past, any piece that shows the best sides of the bygone age. 
It could be a piece of furniture, a structure, a monument,  an instrument, or even people. So show us your take on the good old days. 
After all, old is indeed gold!  [Well, many of you might search for the meaning of vintage. We do not expect photographs of Wine bottles!!
