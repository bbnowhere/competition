    Dear fellow research mates,

    Do you have any favourite scientific equipment of interest? Or do you use an instrument or a technique
    of which you are master/expert?

    Many people have Carpal tunnel syndrome, pipette is their tool

    A lot of people have Coomassie in their hands, their hobby is running gels

    If you like piercing cell with a needle and electrocute it, you are master of patch clamp!

    If you get 10 colonies on media plate by mixing things that you dreamt last night, hail cloning King.


    You will have your own instrument or technique of interest if you love; freezing things and looking it
    at the Angstroms level, or looking at the endless vertical lines that tell you mass and charge but have
    no clue where they come from, or type ssh and tell your underground friend to do something for you, or
    shine light on something and see that something else is getting shone, or, or, or ? (your turn to tell..)

    Upload your entries at https://intranet.ncbs.res.in/photography



    This month share your favourite instrument – in action or not in action. Or take a snapshot of your
    technique of interest (in its full glory) . There won’t be any internal judges this time. Plus, one
    rule is removed for this month: Identity revelation will not disqualify your entry. (Provided that,
    please don't put alpha-numerals!)



    Alright, try to master some equipment!!
    Cheers!
    The Photography Team.
