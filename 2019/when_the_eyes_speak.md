## THEME : When the eyes speak

As the saying goes ‘Eyes are the windows to a person’s soul.’
Indeed, our eyes are capable of conveying many emotions! Do you get a glimpse
to person’s dreams , thoughts through their eyes? Or have you been bewitched by
a fascinating pair?The eyes that bewitch you need not be human. In fact they
are one of the most widely found sensory organs. The variety of eyes found
throughout the animal kingdom is incredible- be it the eye spots of the
planarians, the compound eyes of insects or the slit like eyes of reptiles. Our eyes allow us to appreciate all the beauty around us but
have you ever tried to appreciate the beauty of the eyes themselves?For this month’s theme, we want you to capture just that.
Show us the eyes that speak to you, fascinate you or even scare you!
