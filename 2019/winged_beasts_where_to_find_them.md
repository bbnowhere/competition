# COMPETITION NO 21

## Theme
last theme was all about capturing messages from the sky.This time we want you to capture some fellows who have conquered the skies!!

Many years ago, Salim Ali suggested that the Great Indian Bustard should be our national bird, because he thought it will enable the then endangered species to be conserved. Well we all know how the script proceeded, and now they are critically endangered. (60 years ago 1250 individuals. In 2018 this number is down to 150)

Do you know where the Great Indian Bustard is?

Do you see any Bustard flying above the tallest statue?

This time we want you to capture such beautiful creatures, rare and common; in action, in flight or simply striking a pose!
