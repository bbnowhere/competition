# Competition No : 30

## Theme : Circle of Life

The theme of this year’s annual talks is ‘Circle of Life’. At the dean’s request, the theme for this month’s competition is the same. 
There is a bonus to the winning entires – they will be featured in the annual talks!
As to the theme, it is open for interpretation. We want to know your thoughts on the ‘circle of life’ and its meaning as interpreted by you. 
It could mean the life cycle, or the shapes of organisms – the more creative, the better!

So put your thinking caps on and keep your cameras ready to tell us your story!

*"It's the circle of life*

*And it moves us all*

*Through despair and hope*

*Through faith and love*

*'Til we find our place*

*On the path unwinding*

*In the circle*

*The circle of life"*

   — ‘Circle of life’ from the movie ‘The Lion King’
