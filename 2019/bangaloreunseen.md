# COMPETITION NO 22

## Theme
Doyou know how many lakes Bangalore (or Bengaluru if you wish) has?  Or it had?

Do you know what were Bangalore’s native flora?

The city of Gardens, the city of IT, the city of Traffic Block, the city for
Education, the city of many many things..

Well,we all are living the Bangalore days..

Given the fact that it is so vast and hectic, one wouldn't be knowing it fully ever. Or
there will be something that only you know or you might have seen.

Then now is the time for you to unveil your clicks to others; showing a Bangalore
that people seldom know. Your captions can be, ‘Tragic Bangalore’, ‘Awesome
Bangalore’, ‘Never-saw-before Bangalore’, ‘Underworld Bangalore’, or
perhaps ‘Namma Bengaluru’..
