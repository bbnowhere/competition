# Competition No : 28

## THEME :Souvenirs

We often would like to remember things, and you will have your own personalized keepsake or generalized memento for that purpose. Souvenir tells a whole story or one unforgettable journey that you have made back in time..

*Objects that serve as memory keepers..*
*Objects that trigger nostalgia in you..*
*That imprint the geographic information of a place you have called at..*
*That carry the essence of local culture and carry the beauty of traditional crafts..*
*— Souvenir.*

*This time we want you to click those enchanted mementos and describe your thoughts about it. It can be a memorable photograph, can be something that you bought from there, or something that you just took with you for granted! (Or define your souvenir in your own way)*
