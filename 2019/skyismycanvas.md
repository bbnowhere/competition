# Competition No 20

## THEME : Sky is my Canvas

The clouds, like Kalidasa said, could be your messenger to your loved ones.. (Go ahead, and illustrate what pattern you observed. Make it very short (50 words))

And the Sun, can make the big yellow flowers stare at him for a day's duration.
There can be many such hidden and marvelous ideas (or truths) that you can find from the sky..
Well, now it's time to write your own Megha Sandesha; show the world how you perceive the sky...
