# Competition No. 23
## THEME : Sepals and Petals

We recently celebrated the festival of colours- holi. Even
nature joins in this springtime celebration with a burst of colourful flowers!
One cannot help but be enchanted by their sweet smell and beautiful colours and
forms.

They do much more than filling our gardens and avenues with colours:  as instruments of plant reproduction,  as a source of sweet reward to many birds and insects, as a symbol of devotion to the almighty or a lover’s adoration of his beloved. 

These are hard to miss, especially on our campus- be it the
flaming red hibiscus, the bright yellow bunches of the copper pod or the exotic
looking inflorescence of the cannon ball tree. 
So get out there and document nature’s holi everywhere!!
