# Competition No : 27

## THEME : Art that Envelope Us

You might have a friend whose room could be mistaken for an art gallery.

And you may have seen nature designing things with an artistic touch and marveled at it. 
We have diverse and indefinite forms of art that enthral us, enslave some, enchant us and enlighten some;
be it a poem, story, drama, dance, painting, crafting ... ... 
This time we want you to look around you, and observe things that have an artistic value...
