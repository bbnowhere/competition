## THEME: Insects the Cosmopolitans

A human boy and girl:

“Yo!

We are sapiens

Who own this planet

We own the seas and the lands and the skies and the trees..

Yo!

We are sapiens

Who can do anything on this planet

We can live anywhere, eat anything and travel like a dashing light..”

---

A small insect sitting on a leaf:

“May be not.”
