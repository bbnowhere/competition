## THEME: Insects the Cosmopolitans

A human boy and girl:

“Yo!
We are sapiens
Who own this planet
We own the seas and the lands and the skies and the trees..
Yo!
We are sapiens
Who can do anything on this planet
We can live anywhere, eat anything and travel like a dashing light..”

A small insect sitting on a leaf:
“May be not.”
